                <p>An <strong>Artificial Intelligence Engineer</strong> is a professional who specializes in designing,
                    developing, and deploying AI systems. These engineers use various machine learning, deep learning,
                    and
                    natural language processing (NLP) techniques to build intelligent systems that can simulate
                    human-like
                    decision-making and problem-solving abilities. AI engineers work on creating algorithms and models
                    that help
                    machines perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as image recognition, speech
                    processing, and even autonomous decision-making.</p>
