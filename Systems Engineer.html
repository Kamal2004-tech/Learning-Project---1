                    or
                    entry-level positions in engineering firms to gain exposure to systems engineering processes and
                    practices.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Obtain Relevant Certifications</h3>

                <p>While not always necessary, certifications can enhance your qualifications. Consider obtaining
                    certifications
                    such as:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>INCOSE Certified Systems Engineering Professional (CSEP):</strong> Validates your
                        knowledge and
                        expertise in systems engineering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Management Professional (PMP):</strong> Demonstrates proficiency in project
                        management
                        principles.</li>
                </ul>
