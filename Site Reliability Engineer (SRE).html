                <h1>Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)</h1>

                <p>A <strong>Site Reliability Engineer</strong> (SRE) is a software engineer tasked with ensuring that
                    an
                    organization's services and systems are reliable, scalable, and efficient. SREs combine software
                    engineering
                    and systems engineering to build and manage large-scale, high-availability systems. This role
                    originated at
                    Google and has since been adopted by many other companies, emphasizing the importance of reliability
                    in
                    software development and operations.</p>
