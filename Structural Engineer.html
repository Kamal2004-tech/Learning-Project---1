                <h1>Structural Engineer</h1>

                <p>A <strong>Structural Engineer</strong> is a specialized civil engineer who focuses on the design,
                    analysis,
                    and construction of structures such as buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure. They ensure
                    that these
                    structures are safe, stable, and capable of withstanding various forces, including gravity, wind,
                    earthquakes, and other environmental factors. Their work is critical to the safety and longevity of
                    construction projects.</p>
