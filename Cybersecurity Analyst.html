                <h1>What is a Cybersecurity Analyst?</h1>
                <p>
                    A <strong>Cybersecurity Analyst</strong> is a professional responsible for protecting an
                    organization’s
                    computer systems, networks, and data from cyber threats and attacks. They play a key role in
                    ensuring the
                    confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital assets. Cybersecurity analysts monitor
                    networks,
                    analyze vulnerabilities, implement security measures, and respond to incidents to mitigate risks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As cyber threats continue to evolve, the demand for skilled cybersecurity analysts has grown
                    significantly
                    across industries like finance, healthcare, government, and more. Cybersecurity analysts are often
                    the first
                    line of defense against breaches, data theft, and other malicious activities targeting an
                    organization’s
                    digital
                    infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cybersecurity is a critical field in the modern digital landscape, and the work of cybersecurity
                    analysts
                    helps
                    ensure that sensitive data and critical systems remain secure and resilient against potential
                    attacks.
